# Car rental website
The website consists of three components, a Next.js frontend, a Nest.js backend and a PostgreSQL database. The frontend and backend are connected via a REST API. When the site needs data or needs to change something, it sends a HTTP request to the backend, which handles the logic and communication with the database.

### Database
PostgreSQL is a feature-rich and easy-to-use database. It has additional support for many different types and can be easily extended. The database has a large community, is used by many large companies and is battle tested. Database drivers are available in almost every language.

### Frontend
Next.js is a popular React framework with support for server-side rendering. It leverages the huge Typescript and React ecosystem, so it is a good choice for large-scale application development. It has support for self-hosting or various providers in the cloud.
React itself has a large community of libraries and tools that make building complex applications fast and easy.

### Backend
Nest.js is a Node.js HTTP framework for building efficient and scalable servers that is highly extensible and has built-in support for a large number of techniques and services. It provides a strong CLI and has similarities to popular frameworks such as Angular and Spring. 
Nest.js has tight integration with Typeorm, a powerful ORM that integrates well with PostgreSQL.
